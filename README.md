# Code in Place 2021 Final Project

Your final project is a chance to make any interesting application you would like.

The final project of Code in Place is meant to be a celebration of what you have learned and a chance to explore one of the joys of coding. For the final project you can also design a program to do whatever you like.

We encourage aesthetic programs, interesting algorithms and code that solves a neat problem. You can chose something that you think is cool. We are providing a couple standard projects in case you have trouble choosing one.

Make any project you like!

## Guidelines

Your project could be small and humble or big and expansive. Both are great. All that we care about is that you make one thing that is yours. Examples of great projects could be: a word game on the console, a new image algorithm or filter of your design. It could even be a data science challenge where you explore data (perhaps even the covid19 data).

Please ask for help on Ed if you have trouble (1) deciding on a good project, (2) getting started, (3) conceptual challenges. We are all one big team and we want to support one another.

We’ll be publishing the project showcase on June 1st, so we’d recommend submitting your project by then. If you want to make changes or submit later, you’ll be able to do so until the end of June, and the showcase will be updated periodically

## Submission

Your final deliverable is a 2 minute video along with a title and a short description of what you have done. In the two minute video you can show your program running and explain what you have made.

## Description
A Mad Lib is an interactive story that you add words to. When prompted, you insert a specific type of word. Once all words are added, the story is ready. The end story is usually quite funny.

This is a Mad Libs game developed using Python and Tkinter, many versions of Mad Libs are already available, but I wanted to incorporate a functional GUI into it. 

## Future Improvements
* Integrate options to choose multiple stories.
* Try and integrate data entry validation.
* Integrate a scroll bar.
